# About
Node.js is a Javascript runtime that we will use for backend development (i.e. things that run outside a browser, usually as a server) for our web applications. In particular, you will use this to create a web server for your web applications rather than installing an independent service. It is a full implementation of Javascript and has a sophisticated collection of tools and packages ideal for developing applications with [microservices](https://blog.cloud66.com/beginners-guide-to-building-real-world-microservices-with-node-js/). The official site for Node.js is [nodejs.org](http://nodejs.org) although it's an opensource project entirely hosted on GitHub and there are many other unofficial sources.
