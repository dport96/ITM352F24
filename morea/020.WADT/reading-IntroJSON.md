# About
We will be using JSON throughout the class so you will need to be familiar with it. 

# Read or Watch the Video
- [**Reading:** 10-min introduction to JSON](https://beginnersbook.com/2015/04/json-tutorial/) 
- [**Video:** Learn JSON in 10 Minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiADhChRriM)

# Some helpful tools for JSON
There are a ton of online tools to help you view, edit, format, and check your JSON. Here is one that I like: 

[JSON viewer, editor, formatter, linter](http://jsonviewer.stack.hu/)

Here are some others to try:
[JSON linter](https://jsonlint.com/)

[JSON editor](https://www.cleancss.com/json-editor/)

[JSON Validator](https://www.cleancss.com/json-validator/)

[JSON Viewer and Converter](https://codebeautify.org/jsonviewer)

[Another JSON Viewer and Converter](https://jsonformatter.org/)

Also note that VSCode has several JSON extension packages that can also be helpful when using JSON.
