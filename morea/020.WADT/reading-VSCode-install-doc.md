# About
VS Code will be the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) we will use to develop web applications. It is a sophisticated collection of development tools for:

- editing code 
- managing projects and project files
- accessing documentation
- debugging code 
- static and dynamic code analysis

# Read and install
**First** Find the [appropriate setup instructions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/setup-overview) for your system by selecting a link under the Cross platform section. Download and install VS Code and follow the instructions to get it setup.

**Second** Watch quick tour of [VGetting started with Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/introvideos/basics). You can skip the download, install, and launch if you successfully completed this from above.

**Third** Skim thorough the [VS Code interface overview](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface)

**Important** If you are not already familiar with using a command shell (AKA command shell, command line, terminal) then take a quick look at [Django Girls Command line Tutorial](https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/intro_to_command_line/). We will be making use of VS Code's integrated terminally frequently and you need to know the basics.
