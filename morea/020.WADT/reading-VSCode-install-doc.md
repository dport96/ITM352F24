# Setting up Visual Studio Code (VSCode)

## About
VSCode will be the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) we will use to develop web applications. It is a sophisticated collection of development tools for:

- Editing code 
- Managing projects and project files
- Accessing documentation
- Debugging code 
- Static and dynamic code analysis

## Installation Steps

### 1. Download and Install VSCode
- Go to the [VSCode setup overview page](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/setup-overview) and follow the instructions for your operating system to download and install VSCode.

### 2. Install Python Extension
- After opening VSCode, click on the Extensions icon on the left sidebar (it looks like four squares).
- Search for "Python" and install the Python extension by Microsoft.
- This extension provides IntelliSense, linting, debugging, code formatting, refactoring, and more for Python.

### 3. Install Python Debugger Extension
- In the Extensions view, search for "Python debug" and install the "Python" extension by Microsoft.
- This extension provides a debugger for Python code within VSCode.

### 4. Familiarize with the VSCode Interface
- Review the [VSCode User Interface](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface) documentation to understand the different parts of the VSCode window.
- Familiarize yourself with the Explorer, Editor, and Terminal sections.

### 5. Learn the Command Line Basics
- If you are not already comfortable with using a command shell or terminal, review the [Django Girls Command Line Tutorial](https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/intro_to_command_line/).
- You will be using the integrated terminal in VSCode frequently, so it's important to understand basic command line navigation and commands.

With these steps, you should have VSCode set up with the necessary Python and debugging extensions, and a basic understanding of the VSCode interface and command line usage. This will prepare you to use VSCode effectively for your Python and web development projects.
