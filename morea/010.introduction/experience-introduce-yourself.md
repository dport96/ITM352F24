# E0: Introduce yourself

## Task

For this assignment, post a message to the [Laulima Discussion board](https://laulima.hawaii.edu/portal/site/MAN.84344.201910/tool/9b7f52e2-5ccb-4cff-83c7-ada48c70dad8/forums/list.page) under a reply to my [Welcome to ITM352!](https://laulima.hawaii.edu/portal/site/MAN.84344.201910/tool/9b7f52e2-5ccb-4cff-83c7-ada48c70dad8/posts/list/1364864.page) message in the Class Discussions board. This post provides info to your fellow students, and also verifies that you know about the class discussion board where you will post your BLOG essays throughout the semester. It also gives your first small taste of using more sophisticated HTML well beyond that of ordinary users. 

You **MUST** have the following in your BLOG post:

 1. Your full name
 2. Where you are from
 3. Why you decided to major in MIS or take ITM 352 (for example "My friend is an MIS major and suggested it." or "I went to the MIS Splash event and found MIS might be a good major for me."
 4. Some fun stuff about yourself
 5. A picture of yourself so people can recognize you in class!
 
 You can organize the above in any creative way you wish. See my ["Welcome to ITM 352!" post](https://laulima.hawaii.edu/portal/site/MAN.84344.201910/tool-reset/9b7f52e2-5ccb-4cff-83c7-ada48c70dad8) on the Laulima clog for an example.
 
Click "Post Reply" to my message  at the top-left corner of the page and use the Subject "Greetings from <your name>" where of course you replace <your name> with your actual name.
 
Your first *technical challenge* in this class is to add an "HTML embedded image" to your BLOG post. You will find that you cannot just copy and paste an image in to the message. What you
must do is first "encode" the image into a string of text and then insert
this as an HTML <img> tag. Use base64 encoding. There are many online resources for
converting images to base64. One site is [base-64-image](http://www.base64-image.de/) and another is [freeonlinetools24.](http://freeonlinetools24.com/base64-image). Try not
to use an overly large or high resolution picture. Once you generate the
base64 <img>, copy it to the clipboard, click the "Source" tool on the
message tool bar in your message, then paste the <img> tag into the
message body. Click the Source tool and if you did everything correctly
your picture should appear. Below is an example of a base54 encoded <img> (yours
will be much larger): 

	<img alt=""
	src="data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/4AAQSkZJRgABAQEAMgAyAAD/
	4gxYSUNDX1BST0ZJTEUAAQEAAAxITGlubwIQAABtbnRyUkdCIFhZWiAHzgACAAkABgAxAABh
	Y3NwTVNGVAAAAABJRUMgc1JHQgAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA9tYAAQAAAADTLUhQICAAAAAAAAAA
	AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABFjcHJ0AAABUAAAADNk
	ZXNjAAABhAAAAGx3dHB0AAAB8AAAABRia3B0AAACBAAAABRyWFlaAAACGAAAABRnWFlaAAAC
	LAAAABRiWFlaAAACQAAAABRkbW5kAAACVAAAAHBkbWRkAAACxAAAAIh2dWVkAAADTAAAAIZ2
	aWV3AAAD1AAAACRsdW1pAAAD+" /> 

	
**Do not** upload a picture to an online source and link to it. Use the above 
procedure only!

Remember that EVERYONE in the class will be seeing your message!

Throughout the semester you will be asked to post BLOG essays about class on this message board. You are expected to look at other students BLOGs but not copy them! You will find your fellow students have many interesting and useful things to share.

## Submission instructions:

This assignment must be completed by the *first week of class*. Post a link to your message  in the Laulima E0 assignment submission box. Please follow the instructions above carefully. This is a **graded** assignment.
