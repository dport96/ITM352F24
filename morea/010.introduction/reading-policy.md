## Grading

Your grade in this class will be based upon the following :

**Course Component**|**Percentage of Grade**||
---------------------|:-------------------:|
Experiential Learning|         50%         ||
Assignments          |         50%         ||

<br>

 * Experiential learning (such as in-class labs) are "lightly graded" generally on completeness rather that correctness. That is, if you do all the work, you will generally get full credit unless the quality of your work is so poor that it's the same as not doing it at all.
 
 * Assignments. Approximately once a week you will be given a programming assignment to be completed on your own outside of class.These will account for a significant percentage of your 
 grade but are graded on "complete with sufficient quality" for full credit or
 "did no complete" (DNF) for no credit. Partial credit is generally not given and is at the discretion of the grader. Do not ask or expect partial credit for assignments.

 * Each assignment is worth some number of points, and we strive to review
and grade all assignments within a week of their due date. However, lack of having a grade for an assignment is not an excuse for poor quality work or not doing a subsequent assignment on time.


Your cumulative
number of points and your percentage of points out of all possible will be
available to you throughout the semester. 

For your final grade, I guarantee an
A to all students with at least 90% of all possible points, a B to all
students with points between 80-89%, and a C to all students with point
between 70-79%. Depending upon the way the grading actually works out, I
reserve the right to adjust the percentages downward (so, for example, it may
turn out that 88% could be enough for an A), but I will never adjust the
percentages upward. Thus, it is possible for everyone in the class to receive
an A if everyone in the class earns at least 90% of all points. +/- grades are not 
given in ITM 352. Please don't ask. However, extraordinary performance will be 
given A+ at the instructors discretion.

## Submitting Your Work
Unless specified otherwise, all assignment submissions, quizzes, etc. **must**
be done though Laulima. This is also where you can view you grades as they become available. **DO NOT EVER EMAIL ME WORK YOU EXPECT TO GET GRADED.** I will certainly lose track of it and I cannot easily add it to Laulima for you. You are welcome to send me work you wish me to review or have questions on, but your actual submission should be to Laulima.

## Laptop Policy
You **must** bring your laptop with the required development tools and software to EVERY class. If you have network access issues you are
are responsible for acquiring the materials for class posted to the class web site 
before class begins.

## Assignment Late Policy
Assignments are due at 11:59 p.m. of the
assigned date. They may be turned in late, but they lose 20% each
calendar day (or part thereof) that they are late. No assignment will be
accepted more than four days late. Exception: If you submit your
assignment on the due date but it is past the due time, you will lose
only 10% for the first 8 hours. The 20% policy begins at 8:00 a.m. on
the day after the due date.

## Grade Appeals Procedure
Any appeal that you wish to make regarding a
grade that you were assigned must be done so in writing. Please email
the original work and an explanation why you believe your
grade is in error. If it is worth your time to write the appeal, it is
worth our time to consider it.

## Grade Negotiations
At the end of the semester your grade will be
assigned to you in a strictly objective manner empirically based on your
aggregated scores. Grades therefore are never available for negotiation.
Any student that "has to get an A" should use foresight and diligence to
put forth the necessary attention and effort to achieve their desired
goal.

## Participation
Participation is more than just showing up.  You must
actually participate in the class; that means talking, asking questions,
answering questions, doing the exercises, and being fully present. This also
means coming to class **prepared** by having dome the pre-class lectures
and experiential learnings.  

Excessive absences from class may result in a decrease of a letter
grade, or even a failing grade. Note: there is no way to "make up" 
for missing a lab if you are absent from a class. The grading already leaves
some leeway for missing a small number of classes due to necessity.

If you have any questions about the
expectations or implications of this policy, please ask!
